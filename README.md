# Predicting Violent Crimes

## Description
This repo contains the final project for George Washington University's DATS6202 - Machine Learning 1 course. We compared the effectiveness of a multilayer perceptron model to classical machine learning models in predicting violent crimes in a community using Python.

## File Structure
The files in this repo are organized and contained in the following folders:
1. **Proposal**
   - A proposal for our project
2. **Code**

   This folder contains our data, two code files, and output files from our code. The "2.gridsearch" file can take 80 minutes to run depending on your computer. Run "1.model" to pull from our results if you do not have the time to run "2.gridsearch".
   - "1.model" - run best model
   - "2.gridsearch" - gridsearch to evaluate best hyperparamters for various models
   - Histogram Comparison - plot comparing actual to predicted
   - communities.data - data
   - communities.names - column names
   - modeleval-full - gridsearch results for full dataset
   - modeleval-impute - gridsearch results for imputed dataset
3. **Final Report**
   - A final written report that explains the data, setup, and results of the project.
4. **Presentation**
   - A story of the project process and results
